# PixLedServer
General purpose Spring server to control connected LED things.

This server can be used with ![PixLed Andro√Ød](https://github.com/PaulBreugnot/PixLedAndroid) and ![PixLed ESP32 modules](https://github.com/PaulBreugnot/PixLedModule_Strip) to build an awesome IoT LED strip lighting system!

*More documentation about those projects available asap :wink:*
